📊 Superstore Analytics Dashboard – E-Commerce Sales Insights

This project is part of the Future Interns Data Analytics Track, where I analyzed real e-commerce sales data using Power BI to uncover actionable business insights.
The dashboard highlights product performance, regional profitability, customer segments, and year-over-year trends — giving business leaders a clear view of what’s driving growth and where interventions are needed.

🔍 Project Objectives

Clean and prepare raw e-commerce sales data

📈 Key Business Insights
1. Product Profitability

Most profitable category: Technology – Copiers

Most loss-making category: Furniture – Tables

Conditional color formatting (green → profit, red → loss, gray → average) clearly highlights performance extremes.

2. Regional Performance

Top-performing state: California

Lowest-performing state: Texas

The profit map visual shows hotspots of profit and regions needing improvement.

3. Year-over-Year (YoY) Metrics

The dashboard compares YoY performance for:

Sales

Profit

% Returned Orders

✔️ A special condition marks a negative change in returned orders as green, because fewer returns improve operational efficiency.
✔️ Sales trends are displayed with:

Solid line: Current year

Dashed line: Previous year

4. Segment Analysis

Sales are broken down by:

Consumer

A donut chart helps visualize each segment’s contribution.
